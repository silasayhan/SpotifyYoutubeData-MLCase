Spotify YouTube Dataset: Music Trends Across Platforms
This dataset shows how popular songs perform on both Spotify and YouTube. It includes useful details about each song, like its name, artist, how many times it was played on Spotify, how many views it got on YouTube, and several audio features like danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo.
